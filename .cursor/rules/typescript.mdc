## TypeScript and React Rules

- Write all code in TypeScript. Prefer `.tsx` for React components.
- Use clear English identifiers for variables, functions, and types. Avoid abbreviations and 1â€“2 character names.
- Avoid `any`. Use precise types and interfaces. Exported/public APIs must be explicitly typed.
- Follow guard-clauses and early returns; handle edge cases first. Avoid deep nesting beyond two to three levels.
- Do not catch errors without meaningful handling.

## UI Text and Accessibility

- All user-facing text must be in Czech (`cs-CZ`).
- Ensure accessibility: provide `aria-*` attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.

## Styling and Design

- Use Tailwind CSS.
- Follow the design system colors and typography as defined in [Docs/design_guidelines.md](mdc:Docs/design_guidelines.md) (Light Mode, primary `#4A90E2`, background `#F8F9FA`, text `#212529`).
- Build responsive, mobile-first layouts.

## Content Quality

- Never use lorem ipsum. Use realistic Czech examples relevant to the context (e.g., math tasks, grammar rules).

## Comments and Structure

- Comment only where the intent is non-obvious. Explain "why", not "how".
- Avoid TODO comments; implement the needed behavior.

## Testing and Reliability

- Add unit/integration tests when introducing significant logic.
- Ensure no console warnings or errors in the browser when shipping UI changes.
