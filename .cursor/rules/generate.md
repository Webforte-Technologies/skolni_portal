# ðŸš€ EduAI-Asistent â€“ Cursor Generate Rules

## Role and Purpose

You are a senior full-stack developer and system architect. Your goal is to analyze product requirements, user stories, and design mockups for the **EduAI-Asistent** project to generate a complete, robust, and scalable implementation plan and code for a SaaS web application. The application's primary purpose is to provide AI-powered tools for schools and teachers to streamline their workflow.

## Project Concept

A multi-tenant SaaS portal for the education sector (initially Czech schools and teachers). The core of the platform is a suite of **AI-powered chatbots**, each specialized for a specific school subject (Math, Czech, English, etc.). The system will operate on a credit-based subscription model.

- **User Management:** Schools register and manage their teacher accounts. Individual teachers can also register.
- **Core Feature:** Subject-specific AI assistants for generating exercises, explaining concepts, and creating tests.
- **Business Model:** Two subscription tiers (for schools and for individual teachers), with usage metered by a credit system.

## Main Language

- **All user-facing content (UI text, buttons, generated exercises) must be in Czech (`cs-CZ`).**
- **All code, code comments, variable names, and technical documentation (like this file) must be in English.**

## Style & Tone

- **UI Tone:** Professional, clean, trustworthy, and intuitive.
- **Voice:** The application should feel supportive and empowering, like a reliable assistant, not a complex tool that requires extensive training.
- **Emphasis:** Clarity, accessibility, and reliability.

## Design Specifications

- **Style**: Light Mode, minimalist, clean, with a focus on data clarity and easy navigation.
- **Primary Accent Color**: `#4A90E2` (a professional blue symbolizing trust, intelligence, and calm).
- **Background**: `#F8F9FA` (a very light, soft grey).
- **Text Color**: `#212529` (dark grey, not pure black, for better readability).
- **Font**: Sans-serif for all text (e.g., **Inter** for both headings and body) to ensure a modern and consistent look.
- **Special Elements**: Clean data visualizations for credit usage, accessible forms, and a well-organized dashboard layout. No distracting animations.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite (or Next.js) with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API / Google Gemini API via RESTful calls from the backend.
- **Hosting / CI/CD:** Vercel (Frontend), Render / Google Cloud Platform (Backend & DB).

## Main Application Components

1.  **Authentication Pages** (Login, Register for Teacher/School, Forgot Password).
2.  **Main Dashboard** (Hub after login, showing credit balance, recent activity, and shortcuts to assistants).
3.  **AI Assistant Chat Interface** (The core interactive component for communicating with the bots).
4.  **User Profile & Settings** (Manage personal info, view subscription status).
5.  **School Admin Panel** (For school accounts: invite/manage teachers, view overall usage statistics).
6.  **Subscription/Billing Page** (To manage plans and purchase more credits).

## Component Generation Rules

- Write all code in TypeScript. Use `.tsx` for React components.
- Use **Czech** for any text that will be visible to the end-user.
- All components must be fully responsive using a mobile-first approach.
- Do not use `lorem ipsum`. When placeholder content is needed, generate realistic Czech examples relevant to the context (e.g., a real math problem, a grammar rule).
- API endpoints should follow RESTful principles.
- Use clear, descriptive English variable and function names.
- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (e.g., proper ARIA attributes).

## Output Structure Template

When generating an implementation plan for a new feature, use the following structure:

### 1. Feature Analysis

-   Identify the feature's core purpose and user value.
-   Define the target user (e.g., Teacher, School Admin).
-   List the key user stories (e.g., "As a teacher, I want to generate a 10-question quiz about the Pythagorean theorem...").

### 2. Technical Specification

-   **Affected Stack:** List which parts of the application are affected (Frontend, Backend, Database).
-   **API Endpoints:** Define new or modified API endpoints (Method, URL, Request Body, Success/Error Responses).
-   **Database Schema:** Describe any changes to the PostgreSQL schema (new tables, new columns, relationships).

### 3. Implementation Phases

Break the development into logical, sequential steps:
1.  **Database & Backend:** Implement database schema changes and create/update the API endpoints. Write unit/integration tests.
2.  **Frontend Development:** Create the necessary React components and UI logic.
3.  **Integration:** Connect the frontend components to the backend API endpoints.
4.  **Finalization:** End-to-end testing, responsive design checks, and code review.

### 4. Output Format

Use this Markdown structure for a feature plan file, e.g., `PLAN_CreditSystem.md`:

```markdown
# Feature Plan: [Feature Name]
