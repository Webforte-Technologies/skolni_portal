# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing material generation system in EduAI-Asistent. The current system provides basic AI-powered generation for 6 material types (worksheet, lesson-plan, quiz, project, presentation, activity) but lacks sophisticated content generation, assignment-based creation, and material subtypes. This enhancement will transform the system into a comprehensive, intelligent material generation platform that can create high-quality educational content based on specific assignments and provide specialized subtypes for different educational needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced AI Content Generation

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the AI to generate high-quality, contextually relevant content for each material type, so that I can create professional educational materials without spending hours on content creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher generates a worksheet THEN the system SHALL produce structured exercises with clear problems, step-by-step solutions, and appropriate difficulty progression
2. WHEN a teacher generates a quiz THEN the system SHALL create diverse question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer, essay) with proper answer keys and scoring rubrics
3. WHEN a teacher generates a lesson plan THEN the system SHALL provide detailed timing, learning objectives, activities, materials list, and assessment methods
4. WHEN a teacher generates a project THEN the system SHALL include project phases, deliverables, evaluation criteria, and resource requirements
5. WHEN a teacher generates a presentation THEN the system SHALL create slide outlines with key points, visual suggestions, and speaker notes
6. WHEN a teacher generates an activity THEN the system SHALL provide setup instructions, materials needed, step-by-step procedures, and learning outcomes

### Requirement 2: Assignment-Based Material Generation

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to input a specific assignment or learning objective and have the system generate appropriate materials based on that assignment, so that all materials are aligned with my teaching goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher provides an assignment description THEN the system SHALL analyze the content and suggest the most appropriate material type(s)
2. WHEN generating materials from an assignment THEN the system SHALL extract key learning objectives, difficulty level, and subject matter automatically
3. WHEN an assignment specifies particular skills or concepts THEN the generated materials SHALL focus on those specific areas
4. IF an assignment requires multiple material types THEN the system SHALL offer to generate a complete set of aligned materials
5. WHEN materials are generated from the same assignment THEN they SHALL maintain consistency in terminology, difficulty, and learning objectives

### Requirement 3: Material Subtypes and Specialization

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to choose from specialized subtypes of materials that match my specific teaching needs, so that I can create more targeted and effective educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a worksheet THEN the system SHALL offer subtypes including: Practice Problems, Homework Assignment, Assessment Worksheet, Review Sheet, Guided Practice, and Independent Work
2. WHEN creating a quiz THEN the system SHALL offer subtypes including: Formative Assessment, Summative Test, Pop Quiz, Review Quiz, and Diagnostic Assessment
3. WHEN creating a lesson plan THEN the system SHALL offer subtypes including: Introduction Lesson, Practice Lesson, Review Lesson, Assessment Lesson, and Project-Based Lesson
4. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL offer subtypes including: Research Project, Creative Project, Group Project, Individual Project, and STEM Project
5. WHEN creating a presentation THEN the system SHALL offer subtypes including: Lecture Slides, Student Presentation Template, Review Presentation, and Interactive Presentation
6. WHEN creating an activity THEN the system SHALL offer subtypes including: Warm-up Activity, Main Activity, Closing Activity, Group Work, and Individual Exercise

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Content Structuring

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want generated materials to have proper educational structure and progression, so that students can learn effectively from the materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating practice problems THEN the system SHALL arrange them from simple to complex with appropriate scaffolding
2. WHEN creating quiz questions THEN the system SHALL ensure balanced coverage of learning objectives and varied cognitive levels
3. WHEN generating lesson activities THEN the system SHALL follow pedagogical best practices with clear introduction, development, and conclusion phases
4. WHEN creating project instructions THEN the system SHALL break down complex tasks into manageable steps with clear milestones
5. IF materials include multiple sections THEN each section SHALL build upon previous content logically

### Requirement 5: Customizable Generation Parameters

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to specify detailed parameters for material generation, so that the output matches my exact teaching requirements and student needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any material THEN the teacher SHALL be able to specify subject, grade level, difficulty, duration, and learning objectives
2. WHEN creating worksheets THEN the teacher SHALL be able to set number of problems, problem types, inclusion of answer keys, and formatting preferences
3. WHEN generating quizzes THEN the teacher SHALL be able to specify question distribution, time limits, point values, and question formats
4. WHEN creating lesson plans THEN the teacher SHALL be able to set lesson duration, class size, available resources, and teaching methods
5. IF a teacher has specific curriculum standards THEN the system SHALL align generated content with those standards

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Material Preview and Editing

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to preview and make adjustments to generated materials before finalizing them, so that I can ensure they meet my specific needs and quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN materials are generated THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive preview with all content sections clearly organized
2. WHEN previewing materials THEN the teacher SHALL be able to edit text content, modify questions, and adjust formatting
3. WHEN editing generated content THEN changes SHALL be saved automatically and reflected in real-time
4. IF a teacher wants to regenerate specific sections THEN the system SHALL allow partial regeneration while preserving other content
5. WHEN materials are finalized THEN the teacher SHALL be able to export in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML)

### Requirement 7: Material Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want generated materials to be accurate, age-appropriate, and pedagogically sound, so that I can trust the content quality for my students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating mathematical content THEN all calculations and formulas SHALL be mathematically correct
2. WHEN creating age-specific materials THEN language complexity and content SHALL be appropriate for the specified grade level
3. WHEN generating questions THEN they SHALL have clear, unambiguous wording and correct answers
4. IF materials include factual information THEN it SHALL be accurate and up-to-date
5. WHEN creating assessments THEN they SHALL align with stated learning objectives and provide fair evaluation opportunities

### Requirement 8: Batch Generation and Material Sets

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to generate multiple related materials at once or create complete material sets for a unit, so that I can efficiently prepare comprehensive teaching resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning a teaching unit THEN the teacher SHALL be able to generate a complete set of materials (lesson plans, worksheets, quizzes, activities)
2. WHEN generating material sets THEN all materials SHALL maintain thematic and difficulty consistency
3. WHEN creating multiple worksheets THEN the teacher SHALL be able to specify variations in difficulty or focus areas
4. IF generating assessment materials THEN the system SHALL create both practice and evaluation versions
5. WHEN batch generating THEN the teacher SHALL receive progress updates and be able to review each material individually
