# E2E Test Migration Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Migration Script
```bash
cd frontend
./migrate-tests.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Backup your current 62 failing tests to `tests/old/`
- ✅ Create 3 new, realistic test files
- ✅ Add a test runner script

### 2. Run the New Tests
```bash
./tests/run-core-tests.sh
```

## What This Fixes

### ❌ **Before (62 Failing Tests)**
- Tests expected UI elements that don't exist
- Tests looked for wrong field selectors
- Tests assumed different form structures
- Tests covered features that aren't implemented

### ✅ **After (3 Focused Test Files)**
- **auth-core.spec.ts** - Authentication basics
- **dashboard-core.spec.ts** - Dashboard & navigation
- **ai-generator-realistic.spec.ts** - AI generator core flow

## Test Coverage

### 🔐 **Authentication Tests**
- Login page loads correctly
- Registration page loads correctly
- School registration page loads correctly
- Landing page loads correctly
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet)

### 📊 **Dashboard Tests**
- Dashboard loads and shows user info

## Benefits

1. **Faster Execution** - Fewer, focused tests
2. **Higher Success Rate** - Tests match actual implementation
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Realistic and maintainable
4. **Better Coverage** - Focus on what actually matters

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Tests Pass** - Run the new tests and fix any issues
2. **Add Feature Tests** - Gradually add tests for features you use
3. **Remove Old Tests** - Delete old test files when confident
4. **Expand Coverage** - Add tests for new features as you build them
