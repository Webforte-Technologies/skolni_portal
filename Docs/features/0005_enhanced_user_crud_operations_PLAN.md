# Feature Plan: Enhanced User CRUD Operations for Admin Dashboard

## Brief Description

Enhance the existing comprehensive user CRUD operations in the admin dashboard with advanced features including user activity tracking, detailed user profiles, advanced filtering and search capabilities, user import/export functionality, and enhanced user management workflows. This builds upon the existing CRUD implementation documented in `CRUD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`.

## Current State Analysis

**Existing Capabilities (Already Implemented):**
- Complete user CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- User listing with basic filters (role, school_id, is_active, search)
- User creation via admin interface with role validation
- User updates with role-school consistency validation
- Soft delete functionality
- Bulk operations (activate, deactivate, add/deduct credits, delete)
- Credit management
- School assignment for teachers
- User form components with validation

**Missing Advanced Capabilities:**
- User activity tracking and analytics
- Detailed user profile views with usage statistics
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, credit balance ranges, last login)
- User import/export functionality (CSV/Excel)
- User activity logs and audit trails
- Advanced search with multiple criteria
- User status management (suspended, pending verification)
- User preferences and settings management
- User communication tools (send notifications, messages)

## Implementation Algorithm

### User Activity Tracking

**Activity Logging Flow:**
1. Middleware captures user actions (login, logout, API calls, page views)
2. Activity data stored in `user_activity_logs` table with timestamp and action type
3. User model methods aggregate activity data for analytics
4. Admin interface displays activity charts and logs with filtering options

**Activity Analytics Algorithm:**
1. Query user_activity_logs for specified time range and user
2. Group activities by type and time period (hourly, daily, weekly)
3. Calculate usage patterns, peak activity times, and engagement metrics
4. Generate activity charts and statistics for admin dashboard

### Advanced User Search

**Multi-Criteria Search Algorithm:**
1. Parse search query with multiple criteria (name, email, role, school, date range, status)
2. Build dynamic SQL query with appropriate WHERE clauses and JOINs
3. Apply pagination and sorting
4. Return results with relevance scoring

### User Import/Export

**Export Algorithm:**
1. Query users with specified filters
2. Transform user data to CSV/Excel format
3. Include user statistics and activity data
4. Generate downloadable file with proper headers

**Import Algorithm:**
1. Parse uploaded CSV/Excel file
2. Validate data format and required fields
3. Check for duplicate emails and existing users
4. Create users in batches with error handling
5. Generate import report with success/failure counts

### User Notifications

**Notification System Flow:**
1. Admin selects users and notification type
2. System validates user permissions and notification settings
3. Store notification in `user_notifications` table
4. Send real-time notification via WebSocket (if implemented)
5. Track notification delivery and read status

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Layer and Backend Foundation
1. Create new database tables (`user_activity_logs`, `user_notifications`, `user_preferences`)
2. Implement UserActivity, UserNotification, and UserPreferences models
3. Add new TypeScript types for enhanced user management
4. Create new API endpoints for activity tracking and advanced features
5. Enhance existing user endpoints with additional capabilities

### Phase 2A: Frontend Components and UI
1. Create advanced filtering components
2. Implement user activity visualization components
3. Build user profile and analytics components
4. Create import/export functionality components
5. Implement user notification and status management components

### Phase 2B: Integration and Advanced Features
1. Integrate new components into existing admin pages
2. Implement real-time activity tracking
3. Add advanced search functionality
4. Create user analytics dashboard
5. Implement import/export workflows

### Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
1. Comprehensive testing of all new features
2. Performance optimization for large datasets
3. Security review of new endpoints
4. User experience testing and refinement
5. Documentation updates

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Use database indexes for efficient filtering and search
- Cache frequently accessed user analytics data
- Optimize import/export for large datasets

### Security
- Validate all import data to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting for notification sending
- Ensure proper authorization for all new endpoints
- Audit all user management actions

### Scalability
- Design activity logging to handle high-volume usage
- Implement efficient search algorithms for large user bases
- Use background jobs for import/export operations
- Plan for horizontal scaling of analytics data

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback for all user management actions
- Implement progressive disclosure for complex features
- Ensure responsive design for all new components
- Add helpful tooltips and documentation
