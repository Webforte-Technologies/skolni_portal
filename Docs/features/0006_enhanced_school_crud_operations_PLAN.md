# Feature Plan: Enhanced School CRUD Operations with Action Monitoring

## Brief Description

Implement comprehensive enhanced CRUD operations for schools in the admin dashboard with advanced features including school activity tracking, detailed school profiles, advanced filtering and search capabilities, school import/export functionality, enhanced school management workflows, and action monitoring. This mirrors the enhanced user CRUD implementation documented in `0005_enhanced_user_crud_operations_PLAN.md` but specifically designed for school entities.

## Current State Analysis

**Existing School CRUD Capabilities (Already Implemented):**
- Complete basic school CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- School listing with basic filters (search, is_active)
- School creation via admin interface with validation
- School updates with field validation
- Soft delete functionality
- School details with user statistics (teacher count, admin count, credits)
- School-specific teacher management endpoints

**Missing Enhanced Capabilities:**
- School activity tracking and analytics
- Detailed school profile views with usage statistics and teacher activity
- Advanced filtering (date ranges, teacher count ranges, credit usage ranges)
- School import/export functionality (CSV/Excel)
- School activity logs and audit trails
- Advanced search with multiple criteria
- School status management (active, suspended, pending verification)
- School preferences and settings management
- School notification tools (send notifications to all school users)
- School performance analytics and reporting

## Implementation Algorithm

### School Activity Tracking

**Activity Logging Flow:**
1. Middleware captures school-related actions (admin logins, teacher activities, API calls, configuration changes)
2. Activity data stored in `school_activity_logs` table with timestamp, action type, and school context
3. School model methods aggregate activity data for analytics and reporting
4. Admin interface displays activity charts and logs with filtering options

**School Activity Analytics Algorithm:**
1. Query school_activity_logs for specified time range and school
2. Group activities by type and time period (daily, weekly, monthly)
3. Calculate usage patterns, peak activity times, teacher engagement metrics
4. Generate activity charts and statistics for admin dashboard
5. Aggregate teacher activities within each school for school-level insights

### Advanced School Search

**Multi-Criteria Search Algorithm:**
1. Parse search query with multiple criteria (name, city, contact info, teacher count, credit usage, status)
2. Build dynamic SQL query with appropriate WHERE clauses and JOINs
3. Include aggregated teacher statistics and credit usage data
4. Apply pagination and sorting with relevance scoring
5. Return results with comprehensive school information

### School Import/Export

**Export Algorithm:**
1. Query schools with specified filters and advanced criteria
2. Transform school data to CSV/Excel format including teacher statistics
3. Include aggregated activity data and usage statistics
4. Generate downloadable file with proper headers and formatting

**Import Algorithm:**
1. Parse uploaded CSV/Excel file with school data
2. Validate data format, required fields, and business rules
3. Check for duplicate names and existing schools
4. Create schools in batches with comprehensive error handling
5. Generate detailed import report with success/failure counts and error details

### School Notifications

**School Notification System Flow:**
1. Admin selects schools and notification type
2. System validates permissions and notification settings
3. Store notification in `school_notifications` table
4. Distribute notifications to all users within selected schools
5. Track notification delivery, read status, and engagement metrics

### School Status Management

**Status Change Algorithm:**
1. Validate status transition rules (active -> suspended, etc.)
2. Update school status with audit trail in `school_status_history`
3. Apply cascading effects to school users (suspend/reactivate teachers)
4. Send appropriate notifications to affected users
5. Log administrative action with reason and timestamp

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 2B: Integration and Advanced Features
1. Integrate new components into existing admin pages
2. Implement real-time school activity tracking
3. Add advanced search functionality for schools
4. Create school analytics dashboard

### Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
1. Comprehensive testing of all new school management features
2. Performance optimization for large school datasets
3. Security review of new endpoints and permissions
4. User experience testing and refinement
5. Documentation updates and admin training materials

## Migration from Existing System

### Data Migration Strategy
1. Analyze existing school data structure and relationships
2. Create migration scripts to populate new tables with historical data
3. Implement data validation and cleanup procedures
4. Create rollback procedures for safe migration
5. Test migration process in staging environment

### Feature Flag Implementation

- Allow selective enabling of new functionality per admin user
- Monitor system performance during feature rollout
- Provide fallback to existing school management interface

### Training and Documentation
- Create admin user guides for new school management features
- Develop video tutorials for complex workflows
