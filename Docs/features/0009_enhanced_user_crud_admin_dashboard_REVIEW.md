4. **Performance considerations** - Potential optimization opportunities

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Backend Implementation Review

#### ✅ Strengths

**API Endpoint Implementation (backend/src/routes/admin.ts)**
- **Lines 172-195**: The missing `GET /admin/users/:id` endpoint has been properly implemented
- **Lines 58-61**: Sorting parameters (`order_by`, `order_direction`) are correctly extracted
- **Lines 129-150**: Proper field mapping and SQL injection protection for sorting
- **Lines 69-112**: Enhanced filtering logic with comprehensive parameter handling

**User Model Enhancements (backend/src/models/User.ts)**
- **Lines 131-162**: `findAll()` method properly implements sorting with field validation
- **Lines 464-697**: `advancedSearch()` method provides comprehensive filtering capabilities
- **Lines 412-433**: Proper ORDER BY clause construction with field mapping

#### ⚠️ Issues Found

**1. Data Alignment Issue - Mixed Case Conventions**
```typescript
// backend/src/routes/admin.ts:153-154
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.role, u.is_active, 
       u.school_id, u.credits_balance, u.created_at, u.status, u.last_login_at
```
The backend returns `snake_case` fields but some frontend components expect `camelCase`. This could cause data misalignment.

**2. Potential SQL Injection Risk**
```typescript
// backend/src/models/User.ts:790
SET locked_until = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '${lockDurationMinutes} minutes'
```
Direct string interpolation in SQL query - should use parameterized queries.

**3. Over-Engineering - Large File Size**
The `User.ts` model file has grown to 971 lines, making it difficult to maintain. Consider splitting into separate service classes.

### 2. Frontend Implementation Review

#### ✅ Strengths

**Sorting Implementation (frontend/src/components/admin/UserTableHeader.tsx)**
- **Lines 13-59**: Clean, reusable `SortableHeader` component with proper state management
- **Lines 34-44**: Intuitive sorting icons and direction toggling
- **Lines 89-130**: Comprehensive sortable headers for all major fields

**Bulk Action Confirmations (frontend/src/components/admin/BulkActionConfirmDialog.tsx)**
- **Lines 28-81**: Excellent action-specific confirmation logic
- **Lines 163-176**: Proper confirmation text validation for destructive actions
- **Lines 178-189**: Clear warning messages for destructive operations
- **Lines 146-160**: Credit amount validation for addCredits action

**Enhanced Filtering (frontend/src/components/admin/EnhancedUserFilters.tsx)**
- **Lines 68-75**: Smart active filter counting
- **Lines 77-103**: Proper dependent filter handling
- **Lines 159-202**: Comprehensive filter persistence with URL and localStorage

#### ⚠️ Issues Found

**1. Data Type Inconsistency**
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagementPage.tsx:18-29
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  first_name: string;  // snake_case
  last_name: string;   // snake_case
  // ...
}
```
Frontend expects `snake_case` but some API responses might use `camelCase`.

**2. Missing Error Boundaries**
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/admin/UserManagementPage.tsx:187-202
const response = await api.get<ApiResponse<UsersResponse>>('/admin/users', { params });
// No error boundary wrapper for component crashes
```

**3. Performance Concern - Large Component**
The `UserManagementPage.tsx` file is 854 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities. Consider splitting into smaller components.

**4. Type Safety Issue**
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/admin/UserProfilePage.tsx:74
const userData = response.data.data as UserProfile;
```
Using type assertions instead of proper type guards could lead to runtime errors.

### 3. User Profile Polish Review

#### ✅ Strengths

**Enhanced User Profile Card**
- Modern card-based layout with proper spacing
- Responsive design considerations
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Proper error handling

**Profile Editing Functionality**
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Proper API integration

#### ⚠️ Issues Found

**1. Missing Component**
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/admin/UserProfilePage.tsx:6
import EnhancedUserProfileCard from '../../components/admin/EnhancedUserProfileCard';
```
This component is imported but doesn't exist in the codebase, which would cause a build error.

**2. Inconsistent API Response Handling**
```typescript
// frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx:31-36
const res = await api.get<MeResponse['data']>('/users/me');
if (res.data.success && res.data.data) {
  setData(res.data.data);
}
```
Different API response structure handling across components.

### 4. Filter Persistence Service Review

#### ✅ Strengths

**Comprehensive Persistence (frontend/src/services/filterPersistenceService.ts)**
- **Lines 37-57**: Proper URL parameter handling
- **Lines 74-103**: LocalStorage persistence with error handling
- **Lines 159-202**: Smart API parameter conversion
- **Lines 149-157**: Active filter detection logic

#### ⚠️ Issues Found

**1. Potential Memory Leak**
```typescript
// Lines 37-57: URL manipulation
window.history.replaceState({}, '', url.toString());
```
No cleanup or event listener management for URL changes.

## Security Analysis

### ✅ Security Strengths
1. **Proper authorization** - All admin endpoints protected with role-based access
2. **Input validation** - Sorting fields are validated against allowed lists
3. **SQL injection protection** - Most queries use parameterized statements
4. **Audit logging** - Admin actions are logged via middleware

### ⚠️ Security Concerns
1. **SQL injection risk** in `lockAccount` method (User.ts:790)
2. **Missing rate limiting** for some bulk operations
3. **No CSRF protection** explicitly mentioned

## Performance Analysis

### ✅ Performance Strengths
1. **Caching implementation** - Search results are cached
2. **Pagination** - Proper limit/offset implementation
3. **Lazy loading** - Components load data on demand

### ⚠️ Performance Concerns
1. **N+1 query potential** - Multiple user lookups in bulk operations
2. **Large component re-renders** - UserManagementPage could benefit from memoization
