üìã Project Overview

Goal: Development of a robust and scalable MVP for the EduAI-Asistent platform. The plan is divided into two main parts: first, creating a functional application foundation (the "shell"), and second, integrating the finished AI assistant.

Technology: React (Vite), Node.js (Express.js), PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript

Timeline: August 2025 - October 2025

PART 1: Application Foundation (MVP Shell)

Goal of this part: To have a fully functional web application where users can register, log in, see their credits, and interact with a chat interface. The assistant's response will be static (simulated) for now.

        Create /docs/design_guidelines.md.

        Define the visual style: Light Mode, primary color (#4A90E2), background (#F8F9FA), and typography (Inter font).

    [x] 1.2.3 Create Project Structure Document:

        Create /docs/project_structure.md.

        Formally describe the monorepo structure and the purpose of key files and folders within frontend/ and backend/.

    [x] 1.2.4 Create AI Context & Workflow Files:

        Create /docs/context.aisc and /docs/workflow.md to guide AI-assisted development in Cursor.

1.3: Backend Initial Setup (Node.js/Express)

    [x] 1.3.1 Initialize Node.js Project:

        Navigate into the backend/ directory.

        Run npm init -y to create a package.json file.

    [x] 1.3.2 Install Core Dependencies:

        Run npm install express dotenv cors.

    [x] 1.3.3 Install Dev Dependencies:

        Run npm install -D typescript ts-node nodemon @types/node @types/express @types/cors.

    [x] 1.3.4 Configure TypeScript:

        Run npx tsc --init to create a tsconfig.json file and configure it for a modern Node.js project.

    [x] 1.3.5 Create Initial Server:

        Create a src/ folder with an index.ts file.

        Inside index.ts, write a minimal Express server that listens on a port defined in .env and has a single health-check route (e.g., GET /api/health) that returns a 200 OK status.

    [x] 1.3.6 Add dev script:

        In backend/package.json, add a script: "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts".

1.4: Frontend Initial Setup (React/Vite)

    [x] 1.4.1 Initialize React Project:

        Navigate into the frontend/ directory.

        Run npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts to bootstrap a React + TypeScript project in the current folder.

    [x] 1.4.2 Install Tailwind CSS:

        Follow the official Vite guide to install and configure Tailwind CSS (tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer).

    [x] 1.4.3 Clean Up Boilerplate:

        Remove the default Vite CSS, logos, and content from App.tsx.

    [x] 1.4.4 Create Initial Component:

        In App.tsx, add a simple <h1>EduAI-Asistent</h1> to confirm that the setup and styling are working.

1.5: Development Environment & Tooling

    [x] 1.5.1 Configure Gitignore:

        Create a .gitignore file in the root directory to ignore node_modules, .env files, and build folders (dist, .vercel) across the entire project.

    [x] 1.5.2 Create Environment Variable Templates:

        In both frontend/ and backend/, create a .env.example file listing all required environment variables (e.g., PORT, DATABASE_URL for backend, VITE_API_URL for frontend).

    [x] 1.5.3 (Optional but Recommended) Setup Concurrent Script:

        In the root directory, run npm init -y.

        Install concurrently: npm install concurrently.

        In the root package.json, add a script to run both frontend and backend at the same time: "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix backend\" \"npm run dev --prefix frontend\"". This will allow you to start the entire development environment with a single npm run dev command from the root.

‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Backend & Database (without AI)

Timeline: Weeks 2-4
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Goal: Build the server-side logic, database structure, and the APIs required to run the application.

Tasks:

‚ú® Phase 4: UI/UX Redesign & Feature Polish

Timeline: Week 10
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Goal: Transform the functional MVP into a visually appealing and user-friendly application by adding key features and completely redesigning the main pages.

Tasks:

    4.1 Dashboard Redesign:

        [x] Create a new, more modern layout (e.g., a two-column layout with main content on the left and a sidebar with info on the right).

        [x] Make the credit display more prominent (e.g., a separate, visually distinct card).

        [x] Add icons for each assistant and improve hover effects on the cards.

    4.2 User Account Management:

        [x] Backend: Create a secure PUT /api/users/me endpoint to update user data (name, password).

        [x] Frontend: In the "Account Information" section, add an "Edit" button.

        [x] Frontend: Implement a modal window or a separate page with a form to edit the user's name and change their password.

        [x] Implement conversation history saving to localStorage so the chat is not lost on page refresh.

        [x] Add avatars (or initials) for the user and a bot icon to the chat bubbles.

        [x] Add a button to copy the AI's response to the clipboard.

    4.4 General UX Improvements:

        [x] Implement loading states (spinners or skeleton screens) when fetching data from the API.

        [x] Add a notification system ("toasts") to display success messages (e.g., "Your details have been saved successfully") or errors.

        [x] Add a confirmation modal on logout ("Are you sure you want to log out?").

üßπ Phase 5: Code Optimization & Cleanup

Timeline: Week 11
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Goal: Improve the application's performance and maintainability by removing unused code and optimizing critical parts.

Tasks:

    [x] 5.1 Dead Code Elimination: Use tools (e.g., ts-prune or IDE features) to identify and remove unused files, exports, variables, and functions.

    [x] 5.2 NPM Package Audit: Review the package.json files and remove any dependencies that are no longer used in the project.

    [x] 5.3 Frontend Optimization:

        [x] Review React components and apply React.memo where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

        [x] Check the usage of useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization.

    [x] 5.4 Backend Optimization:

        [x] Review database queries and ensure that key columns (e.g., foreign keys, user emails) have indexes for faster lookups.

üß† Phase 6: Live AI Integration (Math Bot)

Timeline: Week 12
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Goal: Replace the mock AI endpoint with a live connection to the OpenAI API to power a functional "Math Assistant".

Tasks:

    6.1 Backend Preparation:

        [x] Install the official OpenAI client library: npm install openai in the backend/ directory.

        [x] Add OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env.example and .env files in the backend/ directory.

    6.2 Update the AI Assistant API Endpoint:

        [x] Locate the mock API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/assistant/ask).

        [x] Remove the static, predefined response logic.

    6.3 Implement OpenAI API Call:

        [x] Initialize the OpenAI client in your service file using the API key from the environment variables.

        [x] Create a specific "system prompt" to define the bot's behavior. For example: "You are a helpful and patient math tutor for Czech high school students. Explain concepts clearly, step-by-step. Always provide a practical example. Your language must be encouraging and you must always respond in Czech."

        [x] Use the openai.chat.completions.create method to send the user's query (the "user" message) along with the system prompt to a GPT model (e.g., gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo).

    6.4 Process and Return the Live Response:

        [x] Take the response content from the OpenAI API's choice object.

        [x] Return this live response to the frontend.

        [x] Ensure the credit deduction logic remains in place and is executed only upon a successful API call.

        ‚ú® Phase 7: Advanced Features & System Polish

Timeline: Week 14
Status: ‚úÖ Completed
Goal: Enhance the application with key user features, including file generation and multi-chat support, while also fixing the critical credit system logic.

Tasks:

    7.1 Critical Fix: Credit System Logic:

        [x] Backend: Locate the live AI assistant endpoint (POST /api/assistant/ask).

        [x] Backend: Implement a check at the beginning of the endpoint to ensure the user has > 0 credits. If not, return a "402 Payment Required" error.

        [x] Backend: After receiving a successful response from the OpenAI API, decrement the user's credit count in the PostgreSQL database.

    7.2 "Add Credits" Demo Feature:

        [x] Frontend: On the DashboardPage.tsx, add a new button styled as a secondary action, e.g., "+ Add 100 Demo Credits".

        [x] Backend: Create a new secure endpoint, POST /api/users/me/add-credits.

        [x] Backend: This endpoint will find the logged-in user and increment their credit count by 100.

        [x] Frontend: Wire the button to call this new endpoint and then refresh the displayed credit balance upon success.

    7.3 Multi-Chat Session Support (Foundation):

        [x] Frontend: In the ChatPage.tsx UI (e.g., in the header or a new sidebar placeholder), add a "Ôºã New Chat" button.

        [x] Frontend: When this button is clicked, the current conversation state (messages array) should be cleared to start a fresh conversation.

        [x] Frontend (Optional but Recommended): Modify the chat route to include a session ID (e.g., /chat/math/:sessionId). Clicking "New Chat" would navigate to a new UUID, laying the groundwork for saving conversations later.

    7.4 File Generation Feature (Math Worksheets):

        [x] Frontend: In the ChatPage.tsx UI, add a "Generate Worksheet" button near the message input field.

        [x] Backend: Create a new endpoint, POST /api/assistant/generate-worksheet. This endpoint will also deduct credits.

        [x] Backend: This endpoint will construct a highly-specific prompt for the AI, for example: "You are a high school math teacher. Generate a 10-question math worksheet on the topic of 'Quadratic Equations'. Format the output as a clean JSON object with a 'title', 'instructions', and an array of 'questions', where each question has a 'problem' string and an 'answer' string."

        [x] Frontend: When the "Generate Worksheet" button is clicked, it could trigger a modal to ask for the topic. This topic is then sent to the new backend endpoint.

        [x] Frontend: Upon receiving the structured JSON response, create a new component (WorksheetDisplay.tsx) that renders the content in a clean, printable format.


You are absolutely right, my apologies. I will ensure my responses stay in English. Thank you for the reminder.
